# hello-world

My name is Sam Carestia, and I am a recent graduate of the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). I graduated with a BA, but have always been interested in Computer Science. I am currently taking part in the free courses provided at freeCodeCamp. I hope to learn a lot, and maybe even go into web development as a career.
